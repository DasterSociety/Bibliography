The platform is fabricated by combining Flame Retardant 4 as PCB substrate, copper for electric contacts and lines, and SU-8 for the microfluidic circuit, with integration of sensing components in mind. A specific Simulink model provides the most suitable parameters. It studies the dynamic of the activation and represents the transient behavior of a microfluidic circuit that uses the impulsion of pressurized air to move and mix two different reagents. The simulated behavior includes the effect of the channel and chambers dimensions, initial pressure and volume, and fluids properties.

  abstract = {Based on the microfluidic technology, we designed a high-throughput sensor to detect the hydraulic oil contamination. The sensor has two working modes: inductance detection and capacitance detection. The inductance detection mode can detect ferromagnetic and non-ferromagnetic metal particles in the hydraulic oil. By changing the coil connection to switch to the capacitance detection mode, it can detect water droplets and air bubbles in the hydraulic oil. An annular microchannel is designed to increase the detection flow and to shorten the detection time. A pair of silicon steel sheets are built into the annular microchannel to collect the dispersed magnetic field in the detection area, which improves the accuracy in detecting ferromagnetic and non-ferromagnetic particles. Our experiments showed that the detection sensor is more stable when the plane coils have 20 turns. The magnetic field effect of the silicon steel sheet can improve the detection accuracy in inductance detection. Without the silicon steel sheet, the sensor can detect iron particles as small as 60-70 {$\mu$}m with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 1.55 and copper particles as small as 150- 160{$\mu$}m with an SNR of 1.35. With the silicon steel sheet, the sensor can detect iron particles as small as 60- 70{$\mu$}m with an SNR of 3.42 and copper particles as small as 150- 160{$\mu$}m with an SNR of 3.10. Capacitance detection can detect the water droplets of size 190- 200{$\mu$}m and air bubbles of size 260- 270{$\mu$}m.},

  abstract = {Better diagnostics are always essential for the treatment and prevention of a disease. Existing technologies for detecting infectious and non-infectious diseases are mostly tedious, expensive, and do not meet the World Health Organization's (WHO) ASSURED (affordable, sensitive, specific, user-friendly, rapid and robust, equipment-free, and deliverable to end user) criteria. Hence, more accurate, sensitive, and faster diagnostic technologies that meet the ASSURED criteria are highly required for timely and evidenced-based treatment. Presently, the diagnostics industry is finding interest in microfluidics-based biosensors, as this integration comprises all qualities, such as reduction in the size of the equipment, rapid turnaround time, possibility of parallel multiple analysis or multiplexing, etc. Microfluidics deal with the manipulation/analysis of fluid within micrometersized channels. Biosensors comprise biomolecules immobilized on a physicochemical transducer for the detection of a specific analyte. In this review article, we provide an outline of the history of microfluidics, current practices in the selection of materials in microfluidics, and how and where microfluidics-based biosensors have been used for the diagnosis of infectious and non-infectious diseases. Our inclination in this review article is toward the employment of microfluidics-based biosensors for the improvement of already existing/traditional methods in order to reduce efforts without compromising the accuracy of the diagnostic test. This article also suggests the possible improvements required in microfluidic chip-based biosensors in order to meet the ASSURED criteria.},

Following this reaction, the UVevis optical probe in the downstream detection zone of the microfluidic device was used to capture their spectrum and present as F concentration in real-time conditions. An initial study of the developed colorimetric probe with multi-colour change with several binding and chromophore groups such as eOH, eNH and eNO2 groups confirmed its high sensitivity and selectivity for F ions with a detection limit of 0.79 ppm. The performance of the developed optofluidic device was evaluated for the selective, sensitive detection of F ions including real samples out-performing conventional methods. The technology has advantages such as low sample consumption, rapid analysis, high sensitivity and portability.

  abstract = {Concentration of {$\alpha$}-amylase in human serum is a key indicator of various pancreatic ailments and an affordable point-of-care detection of this biomarker can benefit millions suffering from these diseases. In view of this situation, we report the development of a flexible patch-sensor, which simply requires a microdroplet of aqueous starch-FeSO4 solution to detect {$\alpha$}-amylase in serum. The detection is achieved through the generation of mixing vortices (\textasciitilde 12 rpm) inside the droplet with the help of an imposed thermal gradient. Such vortices due to Marangoni and natural convections are found to be strongest at an optimal temperature difference of \textasciitilde 18 \textdegree C \textendash{} 23 \textdegree C across the droplet which in turn facilitate mixing and promote the specific starch-amylase enzymatic reaction. Subsequently, the large (\textasciitilde 80\%) variation in the electrical resistance across the droplet is correlated to detect the level of the {$\alpha$}-amylase in the analyte. Importantly, the sensor can detect even in the limits of 15\textendash 110 units/liter. Further, the sensitivity of flexible sensors is \textasciitilde 8.6\% higher than the non-flexible one. Interestingly, the sensitivity of the proposed sensor has been nearly three-times than the previously reported optical ones. The results of patch-sensor match very closely with the standard path-lab tests while detecting unknown level of amylase in serum. The prototype has shown significant potential to translate into an affordable device for the real-time detection and easy prognosis of pancreatic disorders.},

The in vivo fate of these systems, after intravascular or tumoral administration, is discussed, as well as the mechanism involved in tumor regression. Nanoparticles are also of benefit for the selective delivery of oligonucleotides to tumor cells. Moreover, certain types of nanoparticles showed some interesting capacity to reverse MDR resistance, which is a major problem in chemotherapy. The first experiments, aiming to decorate nanoparticles with molecular ligand for 'active' targeting of cancerous cells, are also discussed here.

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} 2016 IEEE. A data driven approach for the identification of fast two-phase flow nonlinear dynamics was investigated with the characteristics to be easily adopted in different experimental conditions and embedded in a portable device for real-time applications. Two experimental campaigns were conducted using different inputs flow rates and the optical signals acquired were processed and used for the identification step. Starting from the optical process monitoring, an analysis procedure in the frequency domain for the flow characterization was developed and a classification based on bubble frequency obtained. The nonlinear autoregressive with exogene input (NLARX) technique based on the wavelet network was used as identification method for the bubble flow modeling. To evaluate the models performance both in time and frequency domain, two errors were used. Two types of data patterns were considered. In the single patterns a model per experiment was identified and in the collective pattern the same model was used for more experiments.},

However, to date, the speed of image acquisition has been too slow for the efficient detection of moving droplets within segmented flow systems. In this paper, we demonstrate the extraction of fast FT-IR images with acquisition times of 50 ms. This approach allows efficient interrogation of segmented flow systems where aqueous droplets move at a speed of 2.5 mm/s. Consecutive FT-IR images separated by 120 ms intervals allow the generation of chemical movies at eight frames per second. The technique has been applied to the study of microfluidic systems containing moving droplets of water in oil and droplets of protein solution in oil. The presented work demonstrates the feasibility of the use of FT-IR imaging to study dynamic systems with subsecond temporal resolution.},

  abstract = {Current circulating tumor cells (CTCs) detection strategies based on surface epithelial markers suffer from low specificity in distinguishing between CTCs and epithelial cells in hematopoietic cell population. Tumor-associated miRNAs within CTCs are emerging as new biomarkers due to their high correlation with tumor development and progress. However, in-situ simultaneous analysis of multiple miRNAs in single CTC cell is still challenging. To overcome this limitation, a digital droplet microfluidic flow cytometry based on biofunctionalized 2D metal-organic framework nanosensor (Nano-DMFC) is developed for in situ detection of dual miRNAs simultaneously in single living breast cancer cells. Here, 2D MOF-based fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) nanosensors are established by conjugating dual-color fluorescence dye-labeled DNA probes on MOF nanosheet surface. In the Nano-DMFC, 2D MOF-based nanoprobes are precisely microinjected into each single-cell encapsulated droplets to achieve dual miRNA characterization in single cancer cell. This Nano-DMFC platform successfully detects dual miRNAs at single-cell resolution in 10 mixed positive MCF-7 cells out of 10 000 negative epithelial cells in serum biomimic samples. Moreover, this Nano-DMFC platform shows good reproductivity in the recovery experiment of spiked blood samples, which demonstrate the high potential for CTC-based cancer early diagnosis and prognosis.},

We performed this 'mChip' assay in Rwanda on hundreds of locally collected human samples. The chip had excellent performance in the diagnosis of HIV using only 1 mul of unprocessed whole blood and an ability to simultaneously diagnose HIV and syphilis with sensitivities and specificities that rival those of reference benchtop assays. Unlike most current rapid tests, the mChip test does not require user interpretation of the signal. Overall, we demonstrate an integrated strategy for miniaturizing complex laboratory assays using microfluidics and nanoparticles to enable POC diagnostics and early detection of infectious diseases in remote settings.},

This chapter focuses on laser ablation processing of metallic and polymeric thin films used in microelectromechanical systems technology for the fabrication of microfluidic devices with integrated electrodes on printed circuit boards (PCB-MEMS). The fabricated devices has flame retardant (FR)-4 resin as substrate, copper (Cu) as active material and SU-8 polymer as structural material. Cu interdigitated electrodes and a SU-8 microfluidic network are patterned on the FR-4 substrate by a 355 nm diode-pumped Nd: YAG ultraviolet (UV) laser system. The effect of laser power on ablation depth is characterized for Cu films with different roughness as well as for SU-8 films with different percent solids. Likewise, critical dimensions are determined for both materials. The integration of these heterogeneous components into a functional PCB-MEMS device is demonstrated by fabricating a capacitive sensing microstructure for liquid recognition through impedance spectroscopy. The resolution, repeatability and simplicity achieved in this approach, along with the low cost of the involved materials and methods, enable an affordable micromachining technique based on laser ablation with a rapid fabrication-test cycle to develop microelectromechanical structures and active microfluidic devices with potential applications in biosensing, cell culture, drug delivery, transport and sorting of molecules, among others.},

Different functions have been described: dynamic and mechanical support, protection and maintenance of mineral homeostasis. For this, the bone must maintain its active metabolism and be able to adapt its structure to mechanical stimuli repairing the structural damages through the process of remodeling throughout the life. Osteoporosis, Paget's disease, cancer and bone infections, will alter the physiology of the tissue resulting in the loss of its integrity. Bisphosphonates (BFs) are pharmacological agents designed for the treatment of these diseases, their main mechanism of action is the inhibition of bone osteoclastic resorption. Medication related osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) consists of the progressive destruction of the bone tissue, being one of the adverse effects of this type of treatment. For this reason, the objective of this article was to make a review about the main pharmacological and clinical aspects of ONJs related to bisphosphonates in dentistry. Clinical diagnosis and appropriate treatment are essential to reduce the risk of osteonecrosis in patients undergoing antiresorptive therapy or before starting administration. For this reason, prevention is even more important.},

Nanomaterials bound with proteins can result in physiological and pathological changes, including macrophage uptake1,6, blood coagulation7, protein aggregation8 and complement activation7,9, but the mechanisms that lead to these changes remain poorly understood. Here, we show that negatively charged poly(acrylic acid)-conjugated gold nanoparticles bind to and induce unfolding of fibrinogen, which promotes interaction with the integrin receptor, Mac-1. Activation of this receptor increases the NF-{$\kappa$}B signalling pathway, resulting in the release of inflammatory cytokines. However, not all nanoparticles that bind to fibrinogen demonstrated this effect. Our results show that the binding of certain nanoparticles to fibrinogen in plasma offers an alternative mechanism to the more commonly described role of oxidative stress in the inflammatory response to nanomaterials. \textcopyright{} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

  abstract = {The rational function model \{(RFM)\} is widely used as an alternative to physical sensor models for \{3D\} ground point determination with high-resolution satellite imagery \{(HRSI).\} However, owing to the sensor orientation bias inherent in the vendor-provided rational polynomial coefficients \{(RPCs)\}, the geo-positioning accuracy obtained from these \{RPCs\} is limited. In this paper, the performances of two schemes for orientation bias correction (i.e., \{RPCs\} modification and \{RPCs\} regeneration) is presented based on one separate-orbit \{QuickBird\} stereo image pair in Shanghai, and four cases for bias correction, including shift bias correction, shift and drift bias correction, affine model bias correction and second-order polynomial bias correction, are examined. A 2-step least squares adjustment method is adopted for correction parameter estimation with a comparison with the \{RPC\} bundle adjustment method. The experiment results demonstrate that in general the accuracy of the 2-step least squares adjustment method is almost identical to that of the \{RPC\} bundle adjustment method. With the shift bias correction method and minimal 1 ground control point \{(GCP)\}, the modified \{RPCs\} improve the accuracy from the original 23 m to 3 m in planimetry and 17 m to 4 m in height. With the shift and drift bias correction method, the regenerated \{RPCs\} achieve a further improved positioning accuracy of 0.6 m in planimetry and 1 m in height with minimal 2 well-distributed \{GCPs.\} The affine model bias correction yields a geo-positioning accuracy of better than 0.5 m in planimetry and 1 m in height with 3 well-positioned \{GCPs.\} Further tests with the second-order polynomial bias correction model indicate the existence of potential high-order error signals in the vendor-provided \{RPCs\}, and on condition that an adequate redundancy in \{GCP\} number is available, an accuracy of 0.4 m in planimetry and 0.8 m in height is attainable. \{(C)\} 2010 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc. \{(ISPRS).\} Published by Elsevier \{B.V.\} All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Recent years have witnessed an increased use of droplet-based microfluidic techniques in a wide variety of chemical and biological assays. Nevertheless, obtaining dynamic data from these platforms has remained challenging, as this often requires reading the same droplets (possibly thousands of them) multiple times over a wide range of intervals (from milliseconds to hours). In this review, we introduce the elemental techniques for the formation and manipulation of microfluidic droplets, together with the most recent developments in these areas. We then discuss a wide range of analytical methods that have been successfully adapted for analyte detection in droplets. Finally, we highlight a diversity of studies where droplet-based microfluidic strategies have enabled the characterization of dynamic systems that would otherwise have remained unexplorable.},

  abstract = {The present investigation gives a profound insight into the preparation of nucleated nanocomposites of TPU-PDMS blends based on uniquely synthesized PPG-wrapped spherical nanohydroxyapatite (nHap). The spherical nHap at different doses of 1, 3, 5 and 7 phr in different blends of 90: 10, 80: 20, 70: 30, 60: 40, and 50: 50 (TPU: PDMS) were prepared. Based on the mechanical properties of the nanocomposites as well as their scope in the field of biomedical applications, detailed studies were carried out for the 70: 30 blend (T70P30) nanocomposites. The effect of nHap on the mechanical and thermal properties of the T70P30 blend has been thoroughly analysed by using a universal testing machine (UTM), dynamic mechanical analyser (DMA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and a thermogravimetric analyser (TGA). The incorporation of nHap into the T70P30 blend is promoted by the enhanced nucleation effect and has shown a considerable improvement in the tensile strength, storage modulus and thermal stability over the neat blend. The enhancements in these properties are due to better dispersion, which has been confirmed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). DSC revealed the role of filler dosage in nucleation efficiency of nanocomposites. X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies were also carried out for the structural analysis and observed an increasing trend in crystallinity of the nanocomposite with filler dosage. The crystallinity, Tg and {$\Delta$}H values of the nanocomposites with 7 phr nHap (T70P30H7) met the properties of pristine TPU.},

The fiber morphology with interconnected pore network, hydrophilicity, and mechanical properties of electrospun compatibilized blends were markedly influenced by the presence of nHap. The nHap based nanocomposites showed improvement in static and dynamical mechanical properties. Furthermore, the tensile strength was increased by 150\% with the addition of 5 wt\% of nHap in TPU-PDMS blend due to its superior morphology. The enhancement in the dispersion of nHap in TPU-PDMS blend matrix even at higher concentration was confirmed by FESEM, and Micro-CT analysis. Morphology of MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay using human osteoblast-like cells (MG-63) proved all the scaffolds were non-cytotoxic. The TPU-PDMS scaffold with 5 wt\% nHap showed the best performance regarding the cell viability, SBF bioactivity and hemocompatibility which makes its applicability in the fabrication of living bony constructs, especially for bone tissue interfaces.},

  abstract = {According to the Global Burden of Diseases, chronic viral hepatitis B and C are one of the most challenging global health conditions that rank among the first causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Low-\-and middle-\-income countries are particularly affected by the health burden associated with HBV or HCV infection. One major gap in efficiently addressing the issue of viral hepatitis is universal screening. However, the costs and chronic lack of human resources for using traditional screening strategies based on serology and molecular biology preclude any scaling-\-up. Point-\-of-\-care tests have been deemed a powerful potential solution to fill the current diagnostics gap in low-\-resource and decentralized settings. Despite high interest resulting from their development in recent years, very few point-\-of-\-care devices have reached the market. Scaling down and automating all testing steps in 1 single device (eg, sample preparation, detection and readout) is indeed challenging. But innovations in multiple disciplines such as nanotechnologies, microfluidics, biosensors and synthetic biology have led to the creation of chip-\-sized laboratory systems called ``lab-on-a-chip'' devices. This review aims to explain how these innovations can overcome technological barriers that usually arise for each testing step while developing integrated point-\-of-\-care tests. Point-\-of-\-care test prototypes rarely meet the requirements for mass production, which also hinders their large-\-scale production. In addition to logistical hurdles, legal and economic constraints specific to the commercialization of in vitro diagnostics, which have also participated in the low transfer of innovative point-\-of-\-care tests to the field, are discussed.},

  abstract = {T-junction is broadly utilized for phase separation, as it has a notable function as a conduit to distribute fluid, due to its simple design, low maintenance cost and adaptability to offshore industries. The geometrical parameters that influence phase separation make the phase re-distribution unpredictable. Even though the diameter ratio of the T-junction has a prominent effect on phase separation, it was not thoroughly and comprehensively reviewed specifically. This review article intends to fill in that gap, focusing solely on the effect of the diameter ratio on phase separation, specifically for two-phase flow in branching T-junction. Initially, the inversely proportional relation between diameter ratio and phase separation is discussed, reported first in the 1970s. Besides, a critical analysis in 1998, is reported which challenged the inverse proportionality. Unfortunately, their disagreement was not addressed for more than a decade. Lastly, two different criteria to determine the separation efficiency, state-of-the-art T-junction design and side arm modifications are summed up with conclusions. The primary contribution of this research is that it takes into account the agreement and disagreements among the researchers for inverse proportionality between phase separation and diameter ratio, including some critical findings that were not reported in the past in review articles. Some recommendations for future research in this domain are also reported. \'O 2021 Karabuk University. Publishing services by Elsevier B.V.

Besides the critical demands on sensing range of flow parameters (such as rate, velocity, direction and temperature), the properties of different target gases or liquids to be sensed pose challenges to the development of reliable, inexpensive and low powered sensors. This paper presents an overview of the work done on design and development of Microelectromechanical system (MEMS)-based flow sensors in recent years. In spite of using some similar principles, diverse production methods, analysis strategies, and different sensing materials, MEMS flow sensors can be broadly categorized into three main types, namely thermal sensors, piezoresistive sensors and piezoelectric sensors. Additionally, some key challenges and future prospects for the use of the MEMS flow sensors are discussed briefly.},

Polymer coating to IONP, polyethilenglycol (PEG) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), is a widely accepted strategy to prevent toxicity and avoid excessive protein binding. The aim of this study was to assess the role of PC as a potential protector for ROS-induced cytotoxicity and pro-inflammatory response in THP-1 macrophages (exposed to three different IONP: bare, PVP or PEG coated). Cells were exposed to either IONP in RPMI-1640 media or IONP with a preformed human PC. All three IONP showed cytotoxic effects, which in the presence of PC was abolished. IONP-PEG exposure significantly increased ROS, mitochondrial dysfunction and pro-inflammatory cytokines release (IL-1{$\beta$} and TNF-{$\alpha$}). PC presence on IONP-PEG promoted a decrease in ROS and prevented cytokine secretion. Also, presence of PC reduced cell uptake for IONP-bare, but had no influence on IONP-PVP or IONP-PEG. Hence, the reduction in IONP-PEG cytotoxicity can be attributed to PC shielding against ROS generation and pro-inflammatory response and not a differential uptake in THP-1 macrophages. The presence of the PC as a structural element of NP biological entity provides in vivo-relevant conditions for nanosafety testing.},

Herein, we demonstrate a novel, fully integrated, microfluidic amperometric enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) prototype using a commercial interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) as a model antibody binding system. Microfluidic assay chemistry was engineered to take place on Au-plated electrodes within an assay cell on a printed circuit board (PCB)-based biosensor system. The assay cell is linked to an electrochemical reporter cell comprising microfluidic architecture, Au working and counter electrodes and a Ag/AgCl reference electrode, all manufactured exclusively via standard commercial PCB fabrication processes. Assay chemistry has been optimised for microfluidic diffusion kinetics to function under continual flow. We characterised the electrode integrity of the developed platforms with reference to biological sampling and buffer composition and subsequently we demonstrated concentration-dependent measurements of H2O2 depletion as resolved by existing FDA-validated ELISA kits. Finally, we validated the assay technology in both buffer and serum and demonstrate limits of detection comparable to high-end commercial systems with the addition of full microfluidic assay architecture capable of returning diagnostic analyses in approximately eight minutes.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the implementation of a smart-optical detector array for detection and concentration measurement of biochemical parameters in physiological fluids. Its application is in the low-cost microchip size analytical laboratories that use colorimetric detection, by optical absorption, as the analytical technique. The microlaboratory structure is composed of a microplate cuvette array containing the physiological fluids into analysis and an optical detector array underneath, which quantifies the light absorbed by those fluids. The detectors, together with their analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion, are designed and fabricated using a standard CMOS process. The on-chip A/D conversion is performed, simultaneously, using a 1-b first-order sigma-delta converter for each optical detector. The output signal of the device is a bit stream containing information about the absorbed light, which allows simple microcontroller interfacing. The proposed architecture has the main advantage of performing the simultaneous measurement of the light absorbed by the fluids, which avoids the errors that can be introduced due to light fluctuations in uncontrolled environments. In addition, the architecture allows on-chip calibration during each measurement. This means that the device can be reliably used in environments with noncalibrated light sources, e.g., in a doctor's office. The A/D conversion design described here represents significant improvements when compared with the existing designs. Moreover, the microlaboratory application holds great promise, by both improving benefits (quality of health services provided) and reducing costs (of physiological fluid analysis services). \textcopyright{} 2008 IEEE.},

Its activation is easy because it works as a fuse. The fabrication process of the device is based on PCB technology and a typical SU-8 process, using the PCB as a substrate and SU-8 for the microfluidic channels and chambers. The microvalve is intended to be used to impulse small volumes of fluids and it has been designed to be highly integrable in PCB-based microfluidic platforms. The proposed device has been fabricated, integrated and tested in a general purpose microfluidic circuit, resulting in a low activation time, of about 100 {$\mu$}s, and a low consumption of energy, with a maximum of 27 mJ. These results show a significant improvement because the energy consumption is about 84\% lower and the time response is about four orders of magnitude shorter if compared with similar microvalves for impulsion of fluids on PCB-based platforms. \textcopyright{} 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The main objectives of the design are the low cost and the rapid prototyping of the device, which are achieved using a combination of PCB technologies and patterning of SU-8 negative photoresist. PCB is used as the substrate and as the container of the electrical connections, while SU-8 allows the formation of fluidic channels over them. This combination presents many advantages over other fabrication techniques, which are discussed in the paper.

  abstract = {The situation of the COVID-19 pandemic reminds us that we permanently need high-value flexible solutions to urgent clinical needs including simplified diagnostic technologies suitable for use in the field and for delivering targeted therapeutics. From our perspective nanotechnology is revealed as a vital resource for this, as a generic platform of technical solutions to tackle complex medical challenges. It is towards this perspective and focusing on nanomedicine that we take issue with Prof Park's recent editorial published in the Journal of Controlled Release. Prof. Park argued that in the last 15 years nanomedicine failed to deliver the promised innovative clinical solutions to the patients (Park, K. The beginning of the end of the nanomedicine hype. Journal of Controlled Release, 2019; 305, 221\textendash 222 [1]. We, the ETPN (European Technology Platform on Nanomedicine) [2], respectfully disagree. In fact, the more than 50 formulations currently in the market, and the recent approval of 3 key nanomedicine products (e. g. Onpattro, Hensify and Vyxeos), have demonstrated that the nanomedicine field is concretely able to design products that overcome critical barriers in conventional medicine in a unique manner, but also to deliver within the cells new drug-free therapeutic effects by using pure physical modes of action, and therefore make a difference in patients lives. Furthermore, the {$>$}400 nanomedicine formulations currently in clinical trials are expecting to bring novel clinical solutions (e.g. platforms for nucleic acid delivery), alone or in combination with other key enabling technologies to the market, including biotechnologies, microfluidics, advanced materials, biomaterials, smart systems, photonics, robotics, textiles, Big Data and ICT (information \& communication technologies) more generally. However, we agree with Prof. Park that `` it is time to examine the sources of difficulty in clinical translation of nanomedicine and move forward ``. But for reaching this goal, the investments to support clinical translation of promising nanomedicine formulations should increase, not decrease. As recently encouraged by EMA in its roadmap to 2025, we should create more unity through a common knowledge hub linking academia, industry, healthcare providers and hopefully policy makers to reduce the current fragmentation of the standardization and regulatory body landscape. We should also promote a strategy of cross-technology innovation, support nanomedicine development as a high value and low-cost solution to answer unmet medical needs and help the most promising innovative projects of the field to get better and faster to the clinic. This global vision is the one that the ETPN chose to encourage for the last fifteen years. All actions should be taken with a clear clinical view in mind, `` without any fanfare'', to focus ``on what matters in real life'', which is the patient and his/her quality of life. This ETPN overview of achievements in nanomedicine serves to reinforce our drive towards further expanding and growing the maturity of nanomedicine for global healthcare, accelerating the pace of transformation of its great potential into tangible medical breakthroughs.},

Nanohydroxyapatite (nHA) and polypropylene glycol-coated nHA (PPG-nHA) were synthesized by sol-gel technique. Nanocomposites derived from immiscible blends of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) rubber with nHA as the nanofiller were prepared by melt mixing technique and characterized. Transmission electron microscopic images display a significant extent of dispersion of modified and unmodified nHA in the blend matrices. Scanning electron microscopy results show that the incorporation of PPG-nHA leads to a reduction in the particle size of PDMS in the blends. Dynamic storage modulus against strain sweep study reveals the interaction between the polymer matrix and the filler increased by the surface coating of nHA with PPG. Surface coating of nHA with PPG led to the enhancement of physicomechanical properties of the blend nanocomposites. Thermogravimetric analysis shows the incorporation of PPG-nHA increases the degradation temperature of TPU-PDMS blends. Melt rheological studies of the blends and the blend nanocomposites reveal the shear-thinning behavior of the nanocomposites at all different filler loadings, and this shear thinning effect is more prominent in the case of composites at higher loading of the nanofiller.},

Silicon dioxide (SiO2) has emerged as a promising therapy vector for the heart. However, its potential toxicity and mechanisms of damage remain poorly understood. This study provides the first exploration of SiO2-induced toxicity in cultured cardiomyocytes exposed to 7- or 670-nm SiO2 particles. We evaluated the mechanism of cell death in isolated adult cardiomyocytes exposed to 24-h incubation. The SiO2 cell membrane association and internalization were analyzed. SiO2 showed a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration for the 7 nm (99.5 {$\pm$} 12.4 {$\mu$}g/ml) and 670 nm ({$>$}1,500 {$\mu$}g/ml) particles, which indicates size-dependent toxicity. We evaluated cardiomyocyte shortening and intracellular Ca2+ handling, which showed impaired contractility and intracellular Ca2+ transient amplitude during {$\beta$}-adrenergic stimulation in SiO2 treatment. The time to 50\% Ca2+ decay increased 39\%, and the Ca2+ spark frequency and amplitude decreased by 35 and 21\%, respectively, which suggest a reduction in sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) activity. Moreover, SiO2 treatment depolarized the mitochondrial membrane potential and decreased ATP production by 55\%. Notable glutathione depletion and H2O2 generation were also observed. These data indicate that SiO2 increases oxidative stress, which leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and low energy status; these underlie reduced SERCA activity, shortened Ca2+ release, and reduced cell shortening. This mechanism of SiO2 cardiotoxicity potentially plays an important role in the pathophysiology mechanism of heart failure, arrhythmias, and sudden death. NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Silica particles are used as novel nanotechnology- based vehicles for diagnostics and therapeutics for the heart. However, their potential hazardous effects remain unknown. Here, the cardiotoxicity of silica nanoparticles in rat myocytes has been described for the first time, showing an impairment of mitochondrial function that interfered directly with Ca2+ handling.},

Phytochemical conjugated nanotubes were also evaluated for hemo-compatibility, protein binding capacity and in-vitro drug release. Cytotoxicity studies and flow cytometry were performed on U-87 cell lines. Drug release studies confirmed a spatiotemporal pattern of release at the cancer cell pH. Cytotoxicity studies proved that there was 1.28 folds decrease in the IC50 value indicating effective anticancer activity, whereas hemolytic profile established the safety. Flow cytometry confirmed effective induction of apoptosis with minimum necrosis by the nano-conjugate vis-\`a-vis the na\"ive drug. The pharmacokinetic study showcased that there was 4 times escalation in the area under the curve, i.e., bioavailability of the drug after the conjugation to that of plain mangiferin.

  abstract = {A new approach is presented for cell lysate identification which uses SERS-active silver nanoparticles and a droplet-based microfluidic chip. Eighty-nanoliter droplets are generated by injecting silver nanoparticles, KCl as aggregation agent, and cell lysate containing cell constituents, such as nucleic acids, carbohydrates, metabolites, and proteins into a continuous flow of mineral oil. This platform enables accurate mixing of small volumes inside the meandering channels of the quartz chip and allows acquisition of thousands of SERS spectra with 785 nm excitation at an integration time of 1 s. Preparation of three batches of three leukemia cell lines demonstrated the experimental reproducibility. The main advantage of a high number of reproducible spectra is to apply statistics for large sample populations with robust classification results. A support vector machine with leave-one-batchout cross-validation classified SERS spectra with sensitivities, specificities, and accuracies better than 99\% to differentiate Jurkat, THP-1, and MONO-MAC-6 leukemia cell lysates. This approach is compared with previous published reports about Raman spectroscopy for leukemia detection, and an outlook is given for transfer to single cells.},

With global cooperation of governments, industry, researchers, consumer interests, and others, collaborative work has produced a strong and growing foundation of standards from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). A growing toolbox of standards now exists as a valuable resource for coming decades for use in research, health and safety, and commercialization for nanotechnologies. The nanotechnology practitioner is guided to useful standards that detail where we stand, what we know, and what can be applied, from a standards perspective for nanotechnologies. Topics include why standards for nanotechnologies matter, description of ISO/TC229 and IEC/TC113, the role of standards in regulations, and the ISO and IEC standards development process. Select ISO and IEC standards for nanotechnologies are described, with background on their development, including standards for terminology and nomenclature; measurement and characterization; health, safety, and environmental aspects of nanotechnologies; material specifications; performance assessment; and reliability. The application of these standards from one country's perspective (Canada) is described. As outlined, the development of standards for nanotechnologies continues concurrently with research and commercialization to advance responsible and sustainable global trade in nano-enhanced and nano-enabled products and systems. Standards play an important role as an evolving set of tools to be applied to support nanotechnologies.},

  abstract = {Droplet microfluidics offers a unique opportunity for ultrahigh-throughput experimentation with minimal sample consumption and thus has obtained increasing attention, particularly for biological applications. Detection and measurements of analytes or biomarkers in tiny droplets are essential for proper analysis of biological and chemical assays like single-cell studies, cytometry, nucleic acid detection, protein quantification, environmental monitoring, drug discovery, and point-of-care diagnostics. Current detection setups widely use microscopes as a central device and other free-space optical components. However, microscopic setups are bulky, complicated, not flexible, and expensive. Furthermore, they require precise optical alignments, specialized op\- tical and technical knowledge, and cumbersome maintenance. The establishment of efficient, simple, and cheap detection methods is one of the bottlenecks for adopting microfluidic strategies for diverse bioanalytical appli\- cations and widespread laboratory use. Together with great advances in optofluidic components, the integration of optical fibers as a light guiding medium into microfluidic chips has recently revolutionized analytical possi\- bilities. Optical fibers embedded in a microfluidic platform provide a simpler, more flexible, lower-cost, and sensitive setup for the detection of several parameters from biological and chemical samples and enable wide\- spread, hands-on application much beyond thriving point-of-care developments. In this review, we examine recent developments in droplet microfluidic systems using optical fiber as a light guiding medium, primarily focusing on different optical detection methods such as fluorescence, absorbance, light scattering, and Raman scattering and the potential applications in biochemistry and biotechnology that are and will be arising from this.},

Therefore, the implementation of fast, robust and cost effective techniques for its monitoring is required. Here, its spectroscopic characterization and its detection in aqueous environment were carried out using surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy combined with droplet based microfluidics. The Levo molecule interacts with the silver nanoparticles               via               the carboxylate group and it adopts an upright or slightly tilted orientation. Furthermore, it is shown that the presence of Cl               -               ions has a strong influence on the enhancement efficiency of the Raman signal of the target molecule. Thus, for the determination of the limit of detection (LOD) the measurements were carried out in the absence of any electrolytes. The estimated LOD is {$\sim$}0.8 {$\mu$}M and the linear dynamic window ranges between 1\textendash 15 {$\mu$}M. These results were achieved after the normalization of the SERS signal to the Raman mode at 230 cm               -1               . This band was attributed to the               {$\nu$}               (Ag\textendash O) stretching and it accounts for the Levo molecules in the first layer on the Ag nanoparticles.},

The fluorescence lifetime of a fluorophore, a photophysical property which is independent of and complementary to fluorescence intensity, has been incorporated into various imaging and sensing techniques through microscopy, flow cytometry and droplet microfluidics. However, the throughput of fluorescence lifetime activated droplet sorting is orders of magnitude lower than that of fluorescence activated cell sorting, making it unattractive for applications such as directed evolution of enzymes, despite its highly effective compartmentalization of library members. We developed a microfluidic sorter capable of selecting fluorophores based on fluorescence lifetime and brightness at two excitation and emission colors at a maximum droplet rate of 2.5 kHz. We also present a novel selection strategy for efficiently analyzing and/or enriching rare fluorescent members from a large population which capitalizes on the Poisson distribution of analyte encapsulation into droplets. The effectiveness of the droplet sorter and the new selection strategy are demonstrated by enriching rare populations from a {$\sim$}10               8               -member site-directed mutagenesis library of fluorescent proteins expressed in bacteria. This selection strategy can in principle be employed on many droplet sorting platforms, and thus can potentially impact broad areas of science where analysis and enrichment of rare events is needed.},

Recently, we reported that high-throughput detection of various concentrations of a reagent is possible using a continuous gradient microfluidic channel combined with a surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) detection platform. In this continuous flow regime, however, the deposition of nanoparticle aggregates on channel surfaces induces the ``memory effect,'' affecting both sensitivity and reproducibility. To resolve this problem, a SERS-based gradient droplet system was developed. Herein, the serial dilution of a reagent was achieved in a stepwise manner using microfluidic concentration gradient generators. Then various concentrations of a reagent generated in different channels were simultaneously trapped into the tiny volume of droplets by injecting an oil mixture into the channel. Compared to the single-phase regime, this two-phase liquid/liquid segmented flow regime allows minimization of resident time distributions of reagents through localization of reagents in encapsulated droplets. Consequently, the sample stacking problem could be solved using this system because it greatly reduces the memory effect. We believe that this SERS-based gradient droplet system will be of significant utility in simultaneously monitoring chemical and biological reactions for various concentrations of a reagent.},

As working principles and required functional modules depend on target analytes, we categorize the applications of the POCT diagnostic systems according to the analyte types such as proteins, cells, nucleic acids, and metabolites. In each analyte category, detection methods, configuration of POCT lab-on-a-chip modules, and advantages and disadvantages of POCT systems are reviewed and discussed along with future prospects.},

  abstract = {To study the acute and subacute lung toxicity of low dose of ultrafine colloidal silica particles (UFCSs), mice were intratracheally instilled with 0, 0.3, 3, 10, 30 or 100 {$\mu$}g of UFCSs. Cellular and biochemical parameters in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), histological alteration and the body weight were determined at 3 days after instillation. Exposure to 30 or 100 {$\mu$}g of UFCSs produced moderate to severe pulmonary inflammation and tissue injury. To investigate the time response, mice were instilled with 30 {$\mu$}g of UFCSs and sacrificed at intervals from 1 to 30 days post-exposure. UFCSs induced moderate pulmonary inflammation and injury on BALF indices at acute period; however, these changes gradually regressed until recovery during the experiment. Concomitant histopathological and laminin immunohistochemical findings generally correlated to BALF data. TUNEL analyses in UFCSs-treated animals showed a significant increase of the apoptotic index in lung parenchyma at all observation times. 8-OHdG expression occurred in lung epithelial cells and activated macrophages, which correlated to lung lesions in UFCSs-treated mice. These findings suggest that instillation of a small dose of UFCSs causes transient acute moderate lung inflammation and tissue damage. Oxidative stress and apoptosis may underlie the lung tissue injury induction. Keywords. Apoptosis; bronchoalveolar lavage; intratracheal instillation; lung toxicity; oxidative stress; ultrafine colloidal silica. INTRODUCTION Colloidal silica, one of synthetically made amorphous sil-ica that became widely used in many industries and available for various applications, is known to be far less active in producing pulmonary damage when compared to crystalline silica (Warheit et al., 1995). Subchronic inhalation toxicity studies in rats on colloidal silica reported that inhalation exposure of 50 mg/m 3 (2418 {$\mu$}g/lung) or 150 mg/m 3 (7378 {$\mu$}g/lung) Ludox R colloidal silica, 2.9-3.7 {$\mu$}m of mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) ranges, produced transient pulmonary inflammatory responses. The severity and incidence of pulmonary lesions decreased progressively after a 3-month recovery period. The no-observable-effect level (NOEL) was 10 mg/m 3 (489 {$\mu$}g/lung) (Lee and Kelly, 1992; Warheit et al., 1991). Many toxicological studies made it clear that ultrafine particles (diameter {$<$} 100 nm) of various types can cause lung inflammatory responses, epithelial cell hyperplasia, inhibit phagocytosis, increased chemokine expression, lung fi-brosis, increased oxidant-generating abilities, and lung tumors (Brown et al., 2000; Donaldson and MacNee, 2001; Warheit, 2004). Ultrafine particles have been shown to have a greater inflammatory lung responses and the development of particle-mediated lung diseases than the fine particles per given mass (Li et al., 1999; Nemmar et al., 2003). In our previous study, we have described acute pulmonary pathological effects caused by single intratracheal exposure to colloidal},

  abstract = {We investigate the limit of detection for obtaining NMR data of a DNA adduct using modern microscale NMR instrumentation, once the adduct has been isolated at the picomole level. Eighty nanograms (130 pmol) of a DNA adduct standard, N-(2{${'}$}-deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-2acetylaminofluorene 5{${'}$}-monophosphate (AAF-dGMP), in 1.5 {$\mu$}L of D2O with 10\% methanol-d4, in a vial, was completely picked up as a droplet suspended in a fluorocarbon liquid and loaded efficiently into a microcoil probe. This work demonstrates a practical manual method of droplet microfluidic sample loading, previously demonstrated using automated equipment, which provides a severalfold advantage over conventional flow injection. Eliminating dilution during injection and confining the sample to the observed volume produce the full theoretical mass sensitivity of a microcoil, comparable to that of a microcryo probe. With 80 ng, an NMR spectrum acquired over 40 h showed all of the resonances seen in a standard spectrum of AAF-dGMP, with a signal-to-noise ratio of at least 10, despite broadening due to previously noted effects of conformational exchange. Even with this broadening to 5 Hz, a two-dimensional total correlation spectroscopy spectrum was acquired on 1.6 {$\mu$}g in 18 h. This work helps to define the utility of NMR in combination with other analytical methods for the structural characterization of a small amount of a DNA adduct.},

  abstract = {A novel emulsification method was developed for making monodispersed regular-sized cells. Both oil in water (O/W) and water in oil (W/O) emulsion cells were generated by permeating an internal phase into a continuous phase through a silicon microchannel, which was designed and prepared by using semiconductor technology. The microprocessing of O/W (or W/O) emulsion cells was monitored and controlled with a microscope video system. Regular-sized O/W cells were made by a normal hydrophilic microchannel and a glass plate with use of an appropriate surfactant. On the other hand, W/O emulsion cells were made by a hydrophobic microchannel and a glass plate modified with a silane coupler reagent. Regularsized W/O cells were also obtained; therefore, a suitable combination of organic phase, surfactant, and electrolyte should be carefully selected. There is a possibility for creating artificial biological cells with this method. In the water/triolein and lecithin system, when the amount of oil was decreased on the permeate side, polygon or fiber cell types were created, and each cell contacted its neighbors across a thin oil layer like a biological tissue.},

The prepared UV cure epoxy resin exhibited an appropriate melting temperature (56.19 \textdegree C). Contact angle test, SEM, and calcium test was used to investigate the properties of UV-cured coating resin. The water contact angle of the cured prepared resin film showed good hydrophobicity. The SEM results confirmed the uniformity of cured film and UV cure resin dispersion. Transparency and flexibility of the cured film to encapsulate the flexible light emitting diodes are acceptable.

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} 2019, The Author(s). Characterizing the thermal behavior of dispersed droplets within microfluidic channels is crucial for different applications in lab-on-a-chip. In this paper, the physics of droplets volume during their transport over a heater is studied experimentally and numerically. The response of droplets to external heating is examined at temperature ranges of 25\textendash 90 \textdegree C and at different flow rates of the dispersed phase respect to the continuous flow. The results present a reliable prediction of the droplet volume and stability when heating is applied to the droplets at the downstream channel in a quite far distance from the droplets' ejection orifice. Increasing the ratio of flow rate resulted in larger droplets; for instance, the flow ratio of 0.25 produced drops with 40\% larger diameter than the flow rate of 0.1. For every 10 \textdegree C increase in temperature of the droplets, the droplet diameter increased by about 5.7\% and 4.2\% for pure oil and oil with a surfactant, respectively. Also, the droplets showed a degree of instability during their transport over the heater at higher temperatures. Adding SPAN 20 surfactant improved the stability of the droplets at temperatures higher than 60 \textdegree C. The experimentally validated numerical model helped for systemic analysis of the influence of key temperature-dependence parameters (e.g. surface tension, density and viscosity of both phases) on controlling the volume and stability of droplets. Our findings supported to develop highly functional systems with a predetermined droplets performance under high temperatures up to 90 \textdegree C. This report provides a preliminary basis for enhancing the performance of droplet microfluidic systems for digital droplet polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR), continuous flow digital loop-mediated isothermal PCR (LAMP), and droplet-based antibiotic susceptibility testing.},

This article provides details on flow regimes in microchannels with a complex geometry, such as with chicane mixing geometry. Experiments involving water, ink, and a micro digital camera have determined both the micromixer's initial mixing zone, and also the streamlines. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling helped identify the mechanism of stimulating effect; swirling and recirculation were identified as two special cases of the convective mixing process. To characterize the degree of mixing, a function of volume flow rate was proposed. A much higher degree of mixing in vortex flow compared to stratified flow was observed. The relationship between laminar flow and vortices shows a square-law dependence of pressure drop against the volume flow rate. The mixing cost and the mixing energy cost at Reynolds number of 50 are higher for the chicane micromixer than for micromixers without chicanes geometry.},

  abstract = {We present a robust droplet-based device, which enables the fractionation of ultralow flow rate nanoflow liquid chromatography (nano-LC) eluate streams at high frequencies and high peak resolution. This is achieved by directly interfacing the separation column to a micro Tjunction, where the eluate stream is compartmentalized into picoliter droplets. This immediate compartmentalization prevents peak dispersion during eluate transport and conserves the chromatographic performance. Subsequently, nanoliter eluate fractions are collected at a rate of one fraction per second on a high-density microarray to retain the separation with high temporal resolution. Chromatographic separations of up to 45 min runtime can thus be archived on a single microarray possessing 2700 sample spots. The performance of this device is demonstrated by fractionating the separation of a tryptic digest of a known protein mixture onto the microarray chip and subsequently analyzing the sample archive using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). Resulting peak widths are found to be significantly reduced compared to standard continuous flow spotting technologies as well as in comparison to a conventional nano-LC-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry interface. Moreover, we demonstrate the advantage of our high-definition nanofractionation device by applying two different MALDI matrices to all collected fractions in an alternating fashion. Since the information that is obtained from a MALDI-MS measurement depends on the choice of MALDI matrix, we can extract complementary information from neighboring spots containing almost identical composition but different matrices.},

How this interface changes during circulation and its impact on nanoparticle distribution within the body is not understood. Here, we developed a workflow to show that the evolution of proteins on nanoparticle surfaces predicts the biological fate of nanoparticles in vivo. This workflow involves extracting nanoparticles at multiple time points from circulation, isolating the proteins off the surface and performing proteomic mass spectrometry. The mass spectrometry protein library served as inputs, while blood clearance and organ accumulation were used as outputs to train a supervised deep neural network that predicts nanoparticle biological fate. In a double-blinded study, we tested the network by predicting nanoparticle spleen and liver accumulation with upward of 94\% accuracy. Our neural network discovered that the mechanism of liver and spleen uptake is due to patterns of a multitude of nanoparticle surface adsorbed proteins. There are too many combinations to change these proteins manually using chemical or biological inhibitors to alter clearance. Therefore, we developed a technique that uses the host to act as a bioreactor to prepare nanoparticles with predictable clearance patterns that reduce liver and spleen uptake by 50\% and 70\%, respectively. These techniques provide opportunities to both predict nanoparticle behavior and also to engineer surface chemistries that are specifically designed by the body.},

  abstract = {The rapid dissolution of copper oxide (CuO) nanoparticles (NPs) with release of ions is thought to be one of the main factors modulating their toxicity. Here we assessed the cytotoxicity of a panel of CuO NPs (12 nm {$\pm$} 4 nm) with different surface modifications, i.e., anionic sodium citrate (CIT) and sodium ascorbate (ASC), neutral polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), and cationic polyethylenimine (PEI), versus the pristine (uncoated) NPs, using a murine macrophage cell line (RAW264.7). Cytotoxicity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and cellular uptake were assessed. The cytotoxicity results were analyzed by the benchmark dose (BMD) method and the NPs were ranked based on BMD20 values. The PEI-coated NPs were found to be the most cytotoxic. Despite the different properties of the coating agents, NP dissolution in cell medium was only marginally affected by surface modification. Furthermore, CuCl2 (used as an ion control) elicited significantly less cytotoxicity when compared to the CuO NPs. We also observed that the antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine, failed to protect against the cytotoxicity of the uncoated CuO NPs. Indeed, the toxicity of the surface-modified CuO NPs was not directly linked to particle dissolution and subsequent Cu burden in cells, nor to cellular ROS production, although CuO-ASC NPs, which were found to be the least cytotoxic, yielded lower levels of ROS in comparison to pristine NPs. Hierarchical cluster analysis suggested, instead, that the toxicity in the current in vitro model could be explained by synergistic interactions between the NPs, their dissolution, and the toxicity of the coating agents.},

This is done using the capabilities of the Programmable System on a Chip (PSoC\textregistered ) by Cypress Semiconductor, which integrates all of the necessary electrical components. This is in contrast to other recent papers that have developed potentiostats but require technical skills or specialized equipment to produce. This eliminates the process of having to make a printed circuit board and soldering on electronic components. To control the device, a graphical user interface (GUI) was developed in the python programming language. Python is open source, with a style that makes it easy to read and write programs, making it an ideal choice for open source projects. As the developed device is open source and based on a PSoC, modification to implement other electrochemical techniques is straightforward and only requires modest programming skills, but no expensive equipment or difficult techniques. The potentiostat developed here adds to the growing amount of open source laboratory equipment. To demonstrate the PSoC potentiostat in a wide range of applications, we performed cyclic voltammetry (to measure vitamin C concentration in orange juice), amperometry (to measure glucose with a glucose strip), and stripping voltammetry experiments (to measure lead in water). The device was able to perform all experiments and could accurately measure Vitamin C, glucose, and lead.},

  abstract = {Mastitis, inflammation of the bovine mammary gland, is generally caused by intramammary infection with bacteria, and antimicrobials have long been a corner stone of mastitis control. As societal concern about antimicrobial use in animal agriculture grows, there is pressure to reduce antimicrobial use in dairy farming. Point-of-care tests for on-farm use are increasingly available as tools to support this. In this Research Reflection, we consider available culture-dependent and culture-independent tests in the context of ASSURED criteria for low-resource settings, including convenience criteria, scientific criteria and societal criteria that can be used to evaluate test performance. As tests become more sophisticated and sensitive, we may be generating more data than we need. Special attention is given to the relationship between test outcomes and treatment decisions, including issues of diagnostic refinement, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and detection of viable organisms. In addition, we explore the role of technology, big data and people in improved performance and uptake of point-of-care tests, recognising that societal barriers may limit uptake of available or future tests. Finally, we propose that the 3Rs of reduction, refinement and replacement, which have been used in an animal welfare context for many years, could be applied to antimicrobial use for mastitis control on dairy farms.},

Despite the wide use of electrical detection for microfluidic systems, application of impedimetric sensing for droplet systems is very limited. This is mainly due to the insulating oil-based continuous phase used for most aqueous samples of interest. We present modelling and experimental verification of impedimetric detection of hemagglutination in microdroplets. We have detected agglutinated red blood cells in microdroplets and screened whole blood samples for multiple antibody sera using conventional microelectrodes. We were able to form antibody and whole blood microdroplets in PDMS microchannels without any tedious chemical surface treatment. Following the injection of a blood sample into antibody droplets, we have detected the agglutination-positive and negative droplets in an automated manner. In order to understand the characteristics of impedimetric detection inside microdroplets, we have developed the lumped electrical circuit equivalent of an impedimetric droplet content detection system. The empirical lumped element values are in accordance with similar models developed for single phase electrical impedance spectroscopy systems. The presented approach is of interest for label-free, quantitative analysis of droplets. In addition, the standard electronic equipment used for detection allows miniaturized detection circuitries that can be integrated with a fluidic system for a quantitative microdroplet-based hemagglutination assay that is conventionally performed in well plates.},

In contrast to isolated application-specific solutions, a microfluidic platform provides a set of fluidic unit operations, which are designed for easy combination within a well-defined fabrication technology. This allows the easy, fast, and cost-efficient implementation of different application-specific (bio-)chemical processes. In our review we focus on recent developments from the last decade (2000s). We start with a brief introduction into technical advances, major market segments and promising applications. We continue with a detailed characterization of different microfluidic platforms, comprising a short definition, the functional principle, microfluidic unit operations, application examples as well as strengths and limitations of every platform. The microfluidic platforms in focus are lateral flow tests, linear actuated devices, pressure driven laminar flow, microfluidic large scale integration, segmented flow microfluidics, centrifugal microfluidics, electrokinetics, electrowetting, surface acoustic waves, and dedicated systems for massively parallel analysis. This review concludes with the attempt to provide a selection scheme for microfluidic platforms which is based on their characteristics according to key requirements of different applications and market segments. Applied selection criteria comprise portability, costs of instrument and disposability, sample throughput, number of parameters per sample, reagent consumption, precision, diversity of microfluidic unit operations and the flexibility in programming different liquid handling protocols (295 references). \textcopyright{} 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

  abstract = {Multiple nanotherapeutics have been approved for patients with cancer, but their effects on survival have been modest and, in some examples, less than those of other approved therapies. At the same time, the clinical successes achieved with immunotherapy have revolutionized the treatment of multiple advanced-stage malignancies. However, the majority of patients do not benefit from the currently available immunotherapies and many develop immune-related adverse events. By contrast, nanomedicines can reduce \textemdash{} but do not eliminate \textemdash{} the risk of certain life-threatening toxicities. Thus, the combination of these therapeutic classes is of intense research interest. The tumour microenvironment (TME) is a major cause of the failure of both nanomedicines and immunotherapies that not only limits delivery, but also can compromise efficacy, even when agents accumulate in the TME. Coincidentally, the same TME features that impair nanomedicine delivery can also cause immunosuppression. In this Perspective, we describe TME normalization strategies that have the potential to simultaneously promote the delivery of nanomedicines and reduce immunosuppression in the TME. Then, we discuss the potential of a combined nanomedicine-based TME normalization and immunotherapeutic strategy designed to overcome each step of the cancer-immunity cycle and propose a broadly applicable `minimal combination' of therapies designed to increase the number of patients with cancer who are able to benefit from immunotherapy.},

The surface of the transducer is covered with a thin layer of SU-8 polymer by spin coating, which prevents it from direct contact with the Cu electrodes and the liquid sample. This helps to enhance durability, avoid electrode corrosion and contamination of the liquid sample, and to prevent undesirable electrochemical reactions to arise. The transducer's impedance was modeled as a Randles cell, having resistive and reactive components determined analytically using a square wave as stimuli, and a resistor as a current-to-voltage converter. To characterize the node sensitivity under different conditions, three different transducer designs were fabricated and tested for four different fluids, i.e., air, isopropanol, glycerin, and distilled water\textemdash achieving a sensitivity of 1.6965 +/- 0.2028 {$\epsilon$}r/pF. The use of laser ablation allowed the reduction of the transducer footprint while maintaining its sensitivity within an adequate value for the targeted applications.},

The microfluidic devices are made of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and glass with thin film electrodes connected to an impedance-monitoring circuit. Immiscible fluids containing the hydrophobic and hydrophilic phases are injected with syringe pumps and spontaneously break into water-in-oil droplet trains. When a droplet passes between a pair of electrodes in a medium having different electrical conductivity, the resulting impedance change signals the presence of the particle for closed-loop feedback during processing. The circuit produces a digital pulse for input into a computer control system. The droplet detector allows estimation of a droplet's arrival time at the microfluidic chip outlet for dispensing applications. Droplet detection is required in applications that count, sort, and direct microfluidic droplets. Because of their low cost and simplicity, microelectrode-based droplet detection techniques should find applications in digital microfluidics and in three-dimensional printing technology for rapid prototyping and biotechnology.},

A three-electrode configuration electrochemical biosensor consisted of 10-nm-thin gold film working and counter electrodes and a thick-film printed Ag/AgCl reference electrode was fabricated on a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate. Micro-fabrication techniques including sputtering vapor deposition and thick-film printing were used to fabricate the biosensor. This was a roll-to-roll cost-effective manufacturing process making the single-use disposable in vitro HbA1c biosensor a reality. Self-assembled monolayers of 3-Mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) were employed to covalently immobilize anti-HbA1c on the surface of gold electrodes. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed the excellent coverage of MPA-SAM and the upward orientation of carboxylic groups. The hindering effect of HbA1c on the ferricyanide/ferrocyanide electron transfer reaction was exploited as the HbA1c detection mechanism. The biosensor showed a linear range of 7.5\textendash 20 \textmu g/mL of HbA1c in 0.1 M PBS. Using undiluted human serum as the test medium, the biosensor presented an excellent linear behavior (R2 = 0.999) in the range of 0.1\textendash 0.25 mg/mL of HbA1c. The potential application of this biosensor for in vitro measurement of HbA1c for diabetic management was demonstrated.},

One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},

  abstract = {Recent developments in the lab-on-PCB integration technology, highlighting its standardized industrial fabrication potential. Commercialization of lab-on-a-chip devices is currently the ``holy grail'' within the {$\mu$}TAS research community. While a wide variety of highly sophisticated chips which could potentially revolutionize healthcare, biology, chemistry and all related disciplines are increasingly being demonstrated, very few chips are or can be adopted by the market and reach the end-users. The major inhibition factor lies in the lack of an established commercial manufacturing technology. The lab-on-printed circuit board (lab-on-PCB) approach, while suggested many years ago, only recently has re-emerged as a very strong candidate, owing to its inherent upscaling potential: the PCB industry is well established all around the world, with standardized fabrication facilities and processes, but commercially exploited currently only for electronics. Owing to these characteristics, complex {$\mu$}TASs integrating microfluidics, sensors, and electronics on the same PCB platform can easily be upscaled, provided more processes and prototypes adapted to the PCB industry are proposed. In this article, we will be reviewing for the first time the PCB-based prototypes presented in the literature to date, highlighting the upscaling potential of this technology. The authors believe that further evolution of this technology has the potential to become a much sought-after standardized industrial fabrication technology for low-cost {$\mu$}TASs, which could in turn trigger the projected exponential market growth of {$\mu$}TASs, in a fashion analogous to the revolution of Si microchips via the CMOS industry establishment.},

This paper describes the development of a programmable Embedded Potentiostat System (EPS) capable of performing electrochemical sensing over system-on-a-chip platforms. Furthermore, the study explains a circuit design and develops some validation of the entire system. The hardware validation is performed by electrochemical experiments such as Double Step Chronoamperometry (DSC), Linear Sweep Voltammetry (LSV) and Cyclic Voltammetry (CV); moreover, a comparison of the experimental signals between a commercial potentiostat and the EPS was done by analysis of errors on the response signal. Results illustrate that the EPS is capable of handling currents in the range of absolute values of 86.44 to 3000 nA and having control voltages in the range of {$\pm$}2 V. The device can support from 50 to 2000 samples per second. The EPS capabilities were compared with other compact potentiostats. The programmable EPS is an original approach which hugely reduces the hardware complexity and leads the way to create new applications for Point-of-Care or industrial developments with a reusable full electronics module.},

Among the ionization techniques, matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) is one of the most generally used for IMS, which allows the analysis of numerous biomolecules ranging over wide molecular weights. Proper selection and preparation of matrix is essential for successful imaging using IMS. Tandem mass spectrometry, which is referred to MSn, enables the structural analysis of a molecule detected by the first step of IMS. Applications of IMS were initially developed for studying proteins or peptides. At present, however, targets of IMS research have expanded to the imaging of small endogenous metabolites such as lipids, exogenous drug pharmacokinetics, exploring new disease markers, and other new scientific fields. We hope that this new technology will open a new era for biophysics.},

Point-of-care (POC) diagnostics have emerged as a strong tool for the diagnosis of viral infections, especially in countries where health-care systems are inadequate to provide proper services to all citizens. According to the World Health Organization, an ideal POC diagnostic must be Affordable, Sensitive, Specific, User-friendly, Rapid/Robust, Equipment-free and Deliverable (ASSURED). This review surveys carefully each ASSURED criterion and identifies where existing viral POC diagnostics fail to meet these criteria. Given the widespread concern with plastic pollution, we also propose the addition of 'disposability' to the existing ASSURED criteria and consider the letter ``D'' as the representative of both Deliverable and Disposable. Next, the POC tests used for the diagnosis of several common human viral infections which met all the ASSURED criteria (ASSURED-compliant) are described in detail. Finally, the future of ASSURED-compliant POC diagnostics, capable of generating comparable results to the viral diagnostic gold standards, is discussed.},

This review summarizes the ddPCR technology and its applications in tuberculosis diagnosis. From current studies including a total of 9 publications on the applications of ddPCR in tuberculosis research, it is clear that ddPCR technology offers enormous advantages, such as unparalleled sensitivity, high precision, and absolute quantification without a standard curve, over common molecular diagnostic platforms like the real-time quantification PCR. The latest study also showed that rapid drug susceptibility test of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in sputa could be achieved within 4 days. However, the high cost is the main limitation for its wide applications, especially in developing countries. As we near the vision 2030 goal for sustainable development and ending the tuberculosis epidemic by 2030, ddPCR techniques may help achieve this objective and many more discussed in the UNGA-HLM-TB.},

Despite the existence of national policy for antenatal screening to prevent congenital syphilis and substantial evidence that antenatal screening is cost-effective, implementation of syphilis screening programmes remains unacceptably low because of lack of screening tools that can be used in primary health care settings. The World Health Organization Sexually Transmitted Diseases Diagnostics Initiative (SDI) has developed the ASSURED criteria as a benchmark to decide if tests address disease control needs: Affordable, Sensitive, Specific, User-friendly, Rapid and robust, Equipment-free and Deliverable to end-users. Rapid syphilis tests that can be used with whole blood approach the ASSURED criteria and can now be deployed in areas where no previous screening has been possible. Although rapid tests for chlamydia and gonorrhoea lack sensitivity, more tests are in development. The way forward for STI diagnostics requires a continuing quest for ASSURED tests, the development of a road map for test introduction, sustainable programmes for quality assurance, and the creation of a robust infrastructure linked to HIV prevention that ensures sustainability of STI control efforts that includes viral STIs.},

  abstract = {Lab-on-PCB devices have been developed for many biomedical and biochemical applications. However, much work has to be done towards commercial applications. Even so, the research on devices of this kind is rapidly increasing. The reason for this lies in the great potential of lab-on-PCB devices to provide marketable devices. This review describes the active flow driving methods for lab-on-PCB devices, while commenting on their main characteristics. Among others, the methods described are the typical external impulsion devices, that is, syringe or peristaltic pumps; pressurized microchambers for precise displacement of liquid samples; electrowetting on dielectrics; and electroosmotic and phase-change-based flow driving, to name a few. In general, there is not a perfect method because all of them have drawbacks. The main problems with regard to marketable devices are the complex fabrication processes, the integration of many materials, the sealing process, and the use of many facilities for the PCB-chips. The larger the numbers of integrated sensors and actuators in the PCB-chip, the more complex the fabrication. In addition, the flow driving-integrated devices increase that difficulty. Moreover, the biological applications are demanding. They require transparency, biocompatibility, and specific ambient conditions. All the problems have to be solved when trying to reach repetitiveness and reliability, for both the fabrication process and the working of the lab-on-PCB, including the flow driving system.},

  abstract = {The expansion of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) throughout the world has alarmed all health professionals. Especially in dentistry, there is a growing concern due to it's high virulence and routes of transmission through saliva aerosols. The virus keeps viable on air for at least 3 hours and on plastic and stainless-steel surfaces up to 72 hours. In this sense, dental offices, both in the public and private sectors, are high-risk settings of cross infection among patients, dentists and health professionals in the clinical environment (including hospital's intensive dental care facilities). This manuscript aims to compile current available evidence on prevention strategies for dental professionals. Besides, we briefly describe promising treatment strategies recognized until this moment. The purpose is to clarify dental practitioners about the virus history and microbiology, besides guiding on how to proceed during emergency consultations based on international documents. Dentists should consider that a substantial number of individuals (including children) who do not show any signs and symptoms of COVID-19 may be infected and can disseminate the virus. Currently, there is no effective treatment and fast diagnosis is still a challenge. All elective dental treatments and non-essential procedures should be postponed, keeping only urgent and emergency visits to the dental office. The use of teledentistry (phone calls, text messages) is a very promising tool to keep contact with the patient without being at risk of infection.},

  abstract = {Since decades, conventional diagnosis and treatment strategies for cancer have been practiced widely despite their expensive and time-consuming process. These conventional contrast and therapeutic agents suffer from various side-effects such as low radiodensity and image resolution, rapid clearance, non-specific biodistribution, poor tumor accumulation, high-dose and multiple-dose requirements, nephrotoxicity, uncontrolled exposure of high electromagnetic radiations, whole-body scans, and so on. Therefore, nanosized imaging and therapeutic probes have been proposed recently owing to their promising efficacy and negligible side-effects. However, these nanoplatforms are struggling deeply to find their clinical translational relevance. Integrating targeting ligands with diagnostic and therapeutic agents within a single system at the nanoscale resulted in localized nanotheranostics. Furthermore, the conceptualized nanotheranostics has been recognized as a clinical `weapon' for localized cancer nanomedicine. In this review, we have covered a wide spectrum of recent developments in cancer nanotheranostics. Numerous examples of functional nanohybrids and clinical relevant materials with their multimode imaging and therapeutics have been addressed here. On the other hand, the importance of combination therapies, imaging-guided tumor regression, deep tissue visualization, localized diagnosis and tumor ablation, manipulation of the tumor microenvironment, and so on have been discussed here. Overall, localized and stimuli responsive nanosized multifunctional platforms have proved their superiority over conventional diagnosis and therapies.},

  abstract = {The merits of nanomedicines are significantly impacted by the surrounding biological environment. Similar to the protein corona generated on the surface of nanoparticles in the circulation system, the intracellular protein corona (IPC) might be formed on nanoparticles when transported inside the cells. However, little is known currently about the formation of IPC and its possible biological influence. Methods: Caco-2 cells, a classical epithelial cell line, were cultured in Transwell plates to form a monolayer. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were prepared as the model nanomedicine due to their excellent stability. Here we focused on identifying IPC formed on the surface of AuNPs during cell transport. The nanoparticles in the basolateral side of the Caco-2 monolayer were collected and analyzed by multiple techniques to verify IPC formation. High-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based proteomics was utilized to analyze the composition of IPC proteins. In particular, we established a dual-filtration strategy to exclude various interference in IPC identification. Based on the subcellular localization of specific IPC proteins, we elicited the nano-trafficking network of AuNPs. The transport pathways of AuNPs identified by proteomic analysis were also verified by various conventional technologies. Finally, we explored the influence of IPC on the uptake and stress response of endothelium. Results: The existence of IPC was demonstrated on the surface of AuNPs, in which 227 proteins were identified. Among them, 40 proteins were finally ascertained as the specific IPC proteins. The subcellular location analysis indicated that these "specific" IPC proteins could back-track the transport pathways of nanoparticles in the epithelial cell monolayer. According to the subcellular distribution of IPC proteins and co-localization, we discovered a new pathway of nanoparticles from endosomes to secretory vesicles which was dominant during the transcytosis. After employing conventional imageology and pharmacology strategies to verify the result of proteomic analysis, we mapped a comprehensive intracellular transport network. Our study also revealed the merits of IPC analysis, which could readily elucidate the molecular mechanisms of transcytosis. Besides, the IPC proteins increased the uptake and stress response of endothelium, which was likely mediated by extracellular matrix and mitochondrion-related IPC proteins. Conclusion: The comprehensive proteomic analysis of IPC enabled tracing of transport pathways in epithelial cells as well as revealing the biological impact of nanoparticles on endothelium.},

The capacitance of the electrodes in air (room environment) is 0.39 pF. Due to the higher dielectric constant of distilled water (80.1), in the water medium the electrode capacitance is 0.77 pF. We also measured the capacitance of the electrodes by changing the medium to microbio objects such as yeast cells (5 pF) and live bacteria cells (30 pF). The results showed that bacteria have a higher electrical capacitance than yeast.},

Deep-neural networks trained to detect certain objects are rapidly emerging as data gathering tools that can either match or outperform the analysis capabilities of the conventional methods used in microfluidic emulsion science. We demonstrate that two types of neural-networks, You Only Look Once (YOLOv3, YOLOv5) and Faster R-CNN, can be trained on a dataset which comprises of droplets generated across several microfluidic experiments and systems. The latitude of droplets used for training and validation, produce model weights which are easily transitive to emulsion systems at large, while completely circumventing any necessity of manual feature extraction. In flow cell experiments which comprised of greater than either 10,000 mono- or polydisperse droplets, the models show excellent or superior statistical symmetry to classical implementations of the Hough transform or widely utilized ImageJ plugins. In more complex chip architectures which simulate porous media, the produced image data typically requires heavy pre-processing to extrapolate valid data, where the models were able to handle raw input and produce size distributions with accuracy of {$\pm$} 2 {$\mu$}m for intermediate magnifications. This data harvesting fidelity is extended to foreign datasets not included in the training such as micrograph observation of various emulsified systems. Implementing these neural networks as the sole feature extraction tools in these microfluidic systems not only makes the data pipelining more efficient but opens the door for live detection and development of autonomous microfluidic experimental platforms due to inference times of greater than 100 frames per second.},

  abstract = {In attempting to analyze, on digital computers, data from basically continuous physical experiments, numerical methods of performing familiar operations must be developed. The operations of differentiation and filtering are especially important both as an end in themselves, and as a prelude to further treatment of the data. Numerical counterparts of analog devices that perform these operations, such as RC filters, are often considered. However, the method of least squares may be used without additional computational complexity and with considerable improvement in the information obtained. The least squares calculations may be carried out in the computer by convolution of the data points with properly chosen sets of integers. These sets of integers and their normalizing factors are described and their use is illustrated in spectroscopic applications. The computer programs required are relatively simple. Two examples are presented as subroutines in the FORTRAN language. \textcopyright{} 1964, American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.},

Water-in-oil emulsions were investigated, since relevant applications have emerged in the recent past for these types of emulsions, such as drug encapsulation as well as droplet-based Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification of DNA, among others. The main contribution of this work is in understanding the main physical phenomena (i.e., total internal reflection, refraction, and interference) behind the complex transmittance pattern obtained for these droplets. For this purpose, a frequency domain electromagnetic wave propagation modelling of the structure using the Finite Element Method (FEM) was used along with experimental measurements.},

In this article,we realize a novel disposable sensor for moisture detection leveraging the material properties of the water absorbing polymer gel common to most diapers. We demonstrate a functional UHF RFID moisture monitor based on hydrogel sensing and propose a hybrid sensor design utilizing metal and hydrogel optimized for a specific diaper geometry. The proposed sensor design achieves a 1-meter read range, a bend radius of {$<$} 20mm, is insensitive to sensor orientation relative to the reader, and is lower-cost than sensors with metallic antennas. We detail design considerations for integration with manufacturing processes and conclude by exploring possible future applications enabled by hydrogel sensing.},

These devices typically consist of microfluidic, chemical, and biological diagnostic components implemented on paper substrates, towards addressing the ASSURED (Affordable, Sensitive, Specific, User friendly, Rapid and Robust, Equipment free and Deliverable to end users) principles set out by the World Health Organization. Paper-based diagnostics primarily contribute to the affordable, equipment-free, and deliverable-to-end-user aspects. However, additional functionality must be integrated with paper-based diagnostic devices to achieve truly ASSURED solutions. Advances in printed electronics provide a fitting foundation for implementing augmented functionality, while maintaining the affordability and disposability of paper-based diagnostics. This paper reviews the printed functional building blocks that contribute towards achieving this goal, from individual printed electronic components to fully integrated solutions. Important modules for sensing, read-out of results, data processing and communication, and on-board power are explored, and solutions printed on flexible or paper-based substrates for integration with paper-based diagnostics are considered. Although many of the unit operations required to achieve the ASSURED criteria can be implemented using paper, basic system functionality is still lacking, and this requires a concerted effort in integration of the various components for truly ASSURED solutions to be realized. Beyond ASSURED, modern clinical practises and crisis readiness also require additional informational functionality, which a systems approach using paper-based solutions could ensure.},

The color change is detected using an absorbance measurement system consisting of a light emitting diode and a photodiode. The linear range of the assay is 9-100mg/dl using a sample dilution factor of 2 and 15-300mg/dl using a sample dilution factor of 3. The results obtained on the electrowetting system compare favorably with conventional measurements done on a spectrophotometer, indicating that there is no change in enzyme activity under electrowetting conditions. \textcopyright{} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we show that enhanced micromixing can be achieved in topologically simple and easily fabricated planar 2D microchannels by simply introducing curvature and changes in width in a prescribed manner. This goal is accomplished by harnessing a synergistic combination of (               i               ) Dean vortices that arise in the vertical plane of curved channels as a consequence of an interplay between inertial, centrifugal, and viscous effects, and (               ii               ) expansion vortices that arise in the horizontal plane due to an abrupt increase in a conduit's cross-sectional area. We characterize these effects by using confocal microscopy of aqueous fluorescent dye streams and by observing binding interactions between an intercalating dye and double-stranded DNA. These mixing approaches are versatile and scalable and can be straightforwardly integrated as generic components in a variety of lab-on-a-chip systems.},

In general, microchannels have been used to deliver the samples of interest to these microcoils; however, these systems tend to have large dead volumes and require more complex fluidic connections. Here, we introduce a two-plate digital microfluidic (DMF) strategy to interface small-volume samples with NMR microcoils. In this system, a planar microcoil is surrounded by a copper plane that serves as the counter-electrode for the digital microfluidic device, allowing for precise control of droplet position and shape. This feature allows for the user-determination of the orientation of droplets relative to the main axes of the shim stack, permitting improved shimming and a more homogeneous magnetic field inside the droplet below the microcoil, which leads to improved spectral lineshape. This, along with high-fidelity droplet actuation, allows for rapid shimming strategies (developed over decades for vertically oriented NMR tubes) to be employed, permitting the determination of reaction-product diffusion coefficients as well as quantitative monitoring of reactive intermediates. We propose that this system paves the way for new and exciting applications for               in situ               analysis of small samples by NMR spectroscopy.},

  abstract = {In this study, we presented a digital analysis with droplet-based microfluidic, which was applied for the detection of {$\beta$}-galactosidase ({$\beta$}-Gal) and AFP. The {$\beta$}-Gal was quantified according to the Poisson Distribution in digital analysis with droplets containing {$\beta$}-Gal and fluorogenic substrate fluorescein di-{$\beta$}-D-galactopyranoside (FDG). In our method, the lowest concentration of {$\beta$}-Gal we could accurately detect was 5 fM. We found that the digital detection could be applied in quantifying protein biomarkers, take AFP for model sample. The AFP was detected through indirect detection with excess streptavidin-conjugated {$\beta$}-galactosidase (SA-{$\beta$}-gal) as signal tag. To be specific, firstly SA-{$\beta$}-gal was conjugated to biotin-labeled AFP antibody, and then the unbounded signal tag in the reaction solution was taken out for digital detection with droplet-based microfluidic. As a result, the AFP could be also indirectly quantified at an fM level through subtraction. This experimental result demonstrated that the indirect detection with droplet-based digital analysis was able to detect biomarkers at a low level with a few samples on an ordinary flow-focusing microfluidic chip.},

The obtained nanowires were characterized with Xray diffraction measurement, scanning electron microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. The XRD results shows that CuO nanowires had monoclinic structure while position and width of Raman A1g peaks of the samples were closely related to size and density of the nanowires.

The variation of mixing characteristics viz., pressure distribution, velocity of fluids, mixing efficiency, concentration distribution, mixing path or length by varying the diffusion coefficients as 1 \^A 10\`A11 m2/s, 5 \^A 10\`A11 m2/s, 1 \^A 10\`A10 m2/shave been evaluated. The output concentration for T-shape micromixer against applied diffusion coefficients are 0.49999 mol/m3, 0.50000 mol/m3 and for Y-shape micromixer, 0.49888, 0.49995 \& 0.50003 mol/m3 respectively. Same output concentration is observed for T-shape micromixer corresponding to 5 \^A 10\`A11 m2/s, 1 \^A 10\`A10 m2/s diffusion inputs. From the analyses of simulation results, it has been observed that with increase in diffusion coefficient, output concentration found to increase, but no significant variations of flow velocity field and pressure distribution were observed. However, flow velocity increased with rise in length of mixing channel. More specifically, flow velocity field found to be maximum of 0.3 m/s for T-Shape while it was 0.16 m/sfor Y-shape. The results leading to improved mixing efficiency are explored in detail. To carry out this work, a software tool COMSOL Multiphysics v 4.3b is used. These kinds of studies are highly useful for developing microfluidic systems for diagnosis, drug delivery, and investigation of disease symptoms.},

  abstract = {Water-in-oil emulsions were produced in microchannels with Y- and T-junction geometries by individual droplet generation. For each microchannel configuration, the effect of the fluids and interface properties as well as of the process conditions was evaluated. The size of the droplets depended mainly on the relative velocity between continuous and dispersed phases and the relative fluid viscosity between phases. Those variables were related to the shear stress between the phases, which caused the droplet detachment. In addition, the interfacial forces played a minor role in Y-junction, and they had no effect in the droplets formation in T-junction microchannels. In Y-junction, a large variation in the droplet size was observed, depending on the system composition and the operating conditions. At low relative velocity and fluid viscosity, no droplets were generated. In contrast, the process in T-junction resulted in a lower variation of droplets size and the droplets were formed even at less favorable conditions. Such results indicate that the knowledge of the mechanism of droplets generation in each microchannel geometry makes it possible to choose the appropriate configuration according to the type of fluid, and the operating conditions can be adjusted to obtain the desired final emulsion.},

The cheap and disposable microfluidic chip generates droplets of an aqueous sample in a stream of perfluorohexane (PFH), which is also used to eject them as a liquid jet. The aqueous droplets remain intact during the ejection and can be transported into the ICP with {$>$}50\% efficiency. The transport is realized via a custom-built system, which includes a membrane desolvator necessary for the PFH vapor removal. The introduction system presented here can generate highly monodisperse droplets in the size range of 40-60 {$\mu$}m at frequencies from 90 to 300 Hz. These droplets produced very stable signals with a relative standard deviation (RSD) comparable to the one achieved with a commercial droplet dispenser. Using the current system, samples with a total volume of {$<$}1 {$\mu$}L can be analyzed. Moreover, the capabilities of the setup for introduction and quantitative elemental analysis of single cells were described using a test system of bovine red blood cells. In the future, other modules of the modern microfludics can be integrated in the chip, such as on-chip sample pretreatment or parallel introduction of different samples.},

At the same time, there are still challenges in its applications, including reduction of cost, simplification of operations, and system minia\- turization. This work proposes a droplet-based multivolume microfluidic device for easy-to-operate and inte\- grated droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). With an ``asymmetrical droplet-splitting'' microstructure, we have successfully prepared both small and big droplets within the same main channel of the microfluidic chip. With the size of (59.1 {$\pm$} 2.2) {$\mu$}m and (106.3 {$\pm$} 3.9) {$\mu$}m in diameter, about 30,000 droplets are produced for multi\- volume ddPCR, and thus to perform a dynamic range of over 104 for DNA molecule quantification. The chip integrates droplet generation, droplet array self-assembly, droplet dPCR, and fluorescence detection on a single device. The quantitative capability of the ddPCR chip was evaluated by measuring template DNA at concen\- trations from 20 to 12,500 copies{$\cdot\mu$}L-1. Benefiting from the characteristics of the wide dynamic range (10 \textasciitilde{} 104 copies{$\cdot\mu$}L-1), easy operation, and miniaturization, the proposed ddPCR device is expected to be used in appli\- cations involving DNA molecule quantification, including diagnosis of genetic disease, single-cell gene expres\- sion, and other biomedical fields.},

As a technique for fabricating microstructures for biological applications, soft lithography overcomes many of the shortcomings of photolithography. In particular, soft lithography offers the ability to control the molecular structure of surfaces and to pattern the complex molecules relevant to biology, to fabricate channel structures appropriate for microfluidics, and to pattern and manipulate cells. For the relatively large feature sizes used in biology ({$\geq$}50 {$\mu$}m), production of prototype patterns and structures is convenient, inexpensive, and rapid. Self-assembled monolayers of alkanethiolates on gold are particularly easy to pattern by soft lithography, and they provide exquisite control over surface biochemistry.},

For diagnosis of HIV infection, some low-cost tests, such as lateral flow tests and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, are already in place and well established. However, portable quantitative tests for rapid HIV monitoring at the point of care have only recently been introduced to the market.

  abstract = {The readiness of microfluidic paper-based analytical devices ({$\mu$}PADs) for real world diagnostic applications is described from various aspects.           ,              Microfluidic paper-based analytical devices ({$\mu$}PADs) have emerged as a promising diagnostic platform a decade ago. In contrast to highly active academic developments, their entry into real-life applications is still very limited. This discrepancy is attributed to the gap between research developments and their practical utility, particularly in the aspects of operational simplicity, long-term stability of devices, and associated equipment. On the basis of these backgrounds, this review attempts to: 1) identify the reasons for success of paper-based devices already in the market, 2) describe the current status and remaining issues of {$\mu$}PADs in terms of operational complexity, signal interpretation approaches, and storage stability, and 3) discuss the possibility of mass production based on established manufacturing technologies. Finally, the state-of-the-art in commercialisation of {$\mu$}PADs is discussed, and the ``upgrades'' required from a laboratory-based prototype to an end user device are demonstrated on a specific example.},

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} 1992-2012 IEEE.This paper presents a feasible solution for a real-time sensing of microfluidic two-phase flow in lab-on-chip devices. A capacitive flow pattern sensor has been realized by employing an interdigital electrode configuration and a thin dielectric film. Three main flow patterns were observed in the microchannel, namely, droplet, short slug, and long slug flows. The output signal from the sensor was a real-time capacitance variation induced by the different flow patterns passing the sensing area. Experimental results give an indication of the flow patterns, due to the profile of capacitance variation. Furthermore, the identification of the flow patterns was achieved by autocorrelation of the capacitance variation and evaluation of a constant, specific for a given flow pattern in terms of linear velocity relation. This two-phase flow pattern sensor has potential to be used with other fluids, as long as they are immiscible and have very distinct dielectric properties.},

  abstract = {Raman spectroscopy can realize qualitative and quantitative characterization, and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) can further enhance its detection sensitivity. In combination with droplet microfluidics, some significant but insurmountable limitations of SERS and Raman spectroscopy can be overcome to some extent, thus improving their detection capability and extending their application. During the past decade, these systems have constantly developed and demonstrated a great potential in more applications, but there is no new review systematically summarizing the droplet microfluidics-based Raman and SERS analysis system since the first related review was published in 2011. Thus, there is a great need for a new review to summarize the ad\- vances. In this review, we focus on droplet microfluidics-based Raman and SERS analysis, and summarize two mainstream research directions on this topic up to now. The one is SERS or Raman detection in the moving droplet microreactors, including analysis of molecules, single cells and chemical reaction processes. The other one is SERS active microparticle fabrication via microfluidic droplet templates covering polymer matrix and photonic crystal microparticles. We also comment on the advantages, disadvantage and correlation resolution of droplet microfluidics for SERS or Raman. Finally, we summarize these systems and illustrate our perspectives for future research directions in this field.},

  abstract = {6-thioguanine is an anticancer drug with narrow safe dose range and intense toxic reactions, so it is urgently necessary to evaluate its clinical usage. Reproducibility and analysis speed are important factors to take into account when analyzing drug concentration in body fluids. In this work, we fabricated a droplet-based microfluidic chip for detecting 6-thioguanine in human serum by using the surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) technique. The easily-prepared Au nanoparticles were used as SERS substrates, and reagent mixing and signal acquiring happened in droplets one by one. This assay device is endowed with the superiority in improving determination repeatability with coefficient of variation of no more than 5\% (n = 25) and high speed of 10 s each assay. The SERS peak at 1295 cm-1 originated from N1-C6 stretching vibration mode of purine ring was selected for quantitating 6-thioguanine. The signals indicated a satisfied linear relationship with the concentrations of 6-thioguanine in the range of 0.010 {$\mu$}M to 10 {$\mu$}M, with a detection limit of 0.032 {$\mu$}M. The droplet-based microfluidic SERS system was successfully applied for credible and rapid analysis of 6-thioguanine in human serum, and is pretty promising for performing the therapeutic drug monitoring.},

  abstract = {A new type of cyclone wet electrostatic precipitator was designed and placed at the end of the power plant. It can effectively remove fine particles and aerosol pollutants represented by PM2.5. It combines the cyclone dust removal and electrostatic dust removal mechanisms so that dust particles are driven into the dust collecting plate under the combined action of the cyclone centrifugal force and the electric field. The dust particles are then captured in the wet cleaning environment. The flow field performance, electric field performance (volt-ampere characteristics and plate current density), and dust removal efficiency of the proposed dust collector were evaluated. Mechanistic analysis and performance test of synergistic removal of fine particles in coal-fired flue gas by multi-field coupling showed that the internal flow field of the dust collector conformed to the flow field characteristics of the cyclone, and the internal electric field performance was excellent. The dust removal efficiency of L1000D130 corona pole and L750D80 corona pole dust collector reached 98.04\% and 97.59\%, respectively. Under different wind speeds, the designed dust collector also exhibited high removal efficiency for fine particles. It can be used as a flue gas treatment end-device for coal-fired power plants.},

A pair of coplanar U-shaped electrodes was used to form a capacitance through droplet microchannels. Liquid metal was injected into polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) channels to form the U-shaped electrodes. The sensor would generate a multi-plateau capacitance waveform as a droplet passes through the sensing area, and each plateau period corresponds to the droplet position in the sensing area. The droplet speed and length would be directly calculated from the multi-plateau capacitance waveform. The errors for the capacitive result relative to the real value were {$<$}7.2\% for length and {$<$}2.8\% for speed. Moreover, the sensor still maintained excellent performance for droplet length and speed measurement even though the microfluidic chip was bent to 96\textdegree. We have demonstrated that the capacitive sensor would be used for sweat rate monitoring.},

By analyzing the interference waves formed by two reflected lights from the droplet surface and the fiber core interface, the fiber optical reflectometer (FOR) is mainly studied in this paper. The wave optics simulation was firstly applied to verify the FOR principle of velocity measurement. Then an experiment system which can generate droplets with different velocities and sizes was designed. Through comparing the results of OFP with photography method, the absolute relative error of chord length measured was within 1.3\%. During the study, it was observed that the intensity of oscillation waves is closely related to the contact position between probe and droplet, so a method for predicting droplet diameter by OFP is proposed. Compared with photography method, the root mean square error of the predicted diameter is 0.051 mm.},

It has been proved to be a promising platform for performing chemical and biological experiments with ultra-small volumes (picoliter to nanoliter) and ultra-high throughput. The ability to analyze the content in droplet qualitatively and quantitatively is playing an increasing role in the development and application of droplet-based microfluidic systems. In this review, we summarized the analytical detection techniques used in droplet systems and discussed the advantage and disadvantage of each technique through its application. The analytical techniques mentioned in this paper include bright-field microscopy, fluorescence microscopy, laser induced fluorescence, Raman spectroscopy, electrochemistry, capillary electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, absorption detection, chemiluminescence, and sample pretreatment techniques. The importance of analytical detection techniques in enabling new applications is highlighted.

Methods for droplet generation can be either passive or active, where the former generates droplets without external actuation, and the latter makes use of additional energy input in promoting interfacial instabilities for droplet generation. A unified physical understanding of both passive and active droplet generation is beneficial for effectively developing new techniques meeting various demands arising from applications. Our review of passive approaches focuses on the characteristics and mechanisms of breakup modes of droplet generation occurring in microfluidic cross-flow, co-flow, flow-focusing, and step emulsification configurations. The review of active approaches covers the state-of-the-art techniques employing either external forces from electrical, magnetic and centrifugal fields or methods of modifying intrinsic properties of flows or fluids such as velocity, viscosity, interfacial tension, channel wettability, and fluid density, with a focus on their implementations and actuation mechanisms. Also included in this review is the contrast among different approaches of either passive or active nature.},

They were further modified with amine-group by employing polyethyleneimine. Through the carbodiimide reaction between amine and carboxyl groups of AuNCs, the AuNCs with significant photothermal conversion efficiency were covalently linked to MEH-PPV nanoparticles. The formed nanocomposites possess stable fluorescence of conjugated polymer and photothermal effect of AuNCs. Cell experiments demonstrated that the nanocomposites were internalized into cancer cells, and exhibited obvious fluorescent signals and photothermal killing efficiency.
